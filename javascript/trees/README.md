<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Binary Tree, BST, and K-Ary Implementation 

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree implementation and testing.

7/5/21: Find the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

7/7/21: Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a k-ary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

#### Approach:
My approach was to follow along with Jacob Knaack during lecture. Any parts I was stuck on, I was able to refer to his code and solve any sticking points I was on.

## Reference

I was assisted by Code Fellows instructor Jacob Knaack's code and lecture. 

I also used the following website to assist me further (along with StackOverflow, of course):
https://towardsdatascience.com/4-types-of-tree-traversal-algorithms-d56328450846 

7/5/21: Jacob Knaack's demo code walked me through this process again, and we all worked on it together as a class.

7/7/21: [I got a push in the right direction from this example on Geeks for Geeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-n-ary-tree-count-number-nodes-number-children-parent/)
