## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

The approach I took was the one recommended by Jacob Knaack during a Code Fellows 401 lecture, recommendations in the code challenge prompt, and those found in our reading [How to Solve Programming Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/). It involved stepping back and breaking down exactly what the problem domain was, and not writing any code until I had a thorough understanding of the problem.
