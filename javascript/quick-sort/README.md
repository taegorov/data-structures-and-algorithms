When I got stuck, I used https://www.acodersjourney.com/quick-sort/ and https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2012/11/27/computer-science-in-javascript-quicksort/ to help guide me. I tried not to straight up see the answer, but rather get a push in the right direction the couple times I was at a sticking point.
