# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

Implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->


    Write a function called left join
    Arguments: two hash maps
        The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
        The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
    Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic


## Approach & Efficiency
